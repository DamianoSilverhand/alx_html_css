# HTML Advanced Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the HTML Advanced exercise. In this project, I have completed the following tasks and learned the associated learning objectives:

## Learning Objectives

- What is HTML and how to create an HTML page from a wireframe.
- Understanding of a markup language and its usage in web development.
- Knowledge of the Document Object Model (DOM) and its significance in web development.
- Understanding of HTML elements/tags and their purpose in structuring a webpage.
- Knowledge of HTML attributes and how they enhance the behavior of HTML elements.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its solutions.
- `html_advanced/index.html`: The HTML file containing the implementation of the header, banner, quote, videos, membership, FAQ, and footer sections.

Feel free to explore the repository to see the individual HTML files for each task.

## How to View the Webpage

To view the implemented webpage, simply open the `html_advanced/index.html` file in a web browser.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Not implemented in this exercise)
- JavaScript (Not implemented in this exercise)

## Author

Damiano Chintala

## Important Note

The implemented webpage might not have any styling (CSS) at the moment, as the focus of this exercise was to create the HTML structure only. CSS will be added in future exercises to enhance the visual appearance of the webpage.
